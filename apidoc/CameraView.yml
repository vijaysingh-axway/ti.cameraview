summary: Allows a Titanium application to create camera.
platforms: [iphone, ipad]

extends: Titanium.Module
description: |
    This module provides facility to create camera. In this camera is created using AVFoundation 
    framework's APIs. So more camera control APIs are available with this module. This module is 
    not rich in native controls of camera. If you are interested in creating custom camera control
    and want to use APIs of AVFoundation framework, it is suitable. If want to use default native 
    camera controls, Titanium.Media is better.

    ### Getting Started

    Add the module as a dependency to your application by adding a **`<module>`** item to the
    **`<modules>`** element of your `tiapp.xml` file:

        <ti:app>
          ...
          <modules>
            <module platform="iphone">ti.cameraview</module>
          </modules>
          ...
        </ti:app>

    Use `require()` to access the module from JavaScript:

        var TiCamera = require("ti.cameraview");

    The `TiCamera` variable is a reference to the module. Make API calls using this reference:

       var camera = TiCamera.createCamera({
            saveToPhotoGallery: true,
            torchMode:TiCamera.TORCH_MODE_OFF,
            success: function(e) {
                Ti.API.info(e.media.width);
            }
        });
        camera.open();
